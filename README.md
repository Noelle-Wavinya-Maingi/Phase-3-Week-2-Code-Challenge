## Project Description
### Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants
 

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Yelp-style domain.
 

We have three models:
- `Restaurant`
- `Customer`
- `Review`
 

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Review`s, and a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.
 

`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many-to-many relationship.
